        <h1><img src="images/nature.jpg" alt="Icon" width="250" align="right">Hobbies</h1>
        <p><b>Snowboarding</b><br>
        Since I was eight years old, I have had a passion for snowboarding. In particular, I really enjoy the park freestyle aspect of snowboarding which includes rails and jumps.
        </p>
        <p><b>Water Sports</b><br>
        In the summers I love to get out to the lakes and go tubing with the family, but my absolute favorite water sports are wakeboarding, knee boarding, and surfing.
        </p>
        <p><b>Exploring</b><br>
        As clich√© as it might sound, I have a passion for exploring new areas. I love exploring the inner cities, hiking trails, and just about anywhere in north Minnesota. Getting lost is a past time that I thoroughly enjoy. If this is something you also enjoy doing, I left a link on the left for new ideas when exploring Minnesota.
        </p>
        <p><b>Video Games</b><br>
        Just like most other people my age that have gone into the computer science field, I love to play videogames. My favorite games to play are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Path of Exile, and OSRS. To who ever may read this, if you play any of these games or want to i left my Steam page on the left side bar. Feel free to add me!
